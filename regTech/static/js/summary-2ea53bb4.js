The CSIRT is an ad-hoc, cross-functional team that is formed to provide a timely response to a suspected computer security violation or incident, support additional system testing, research and recommend viable solutions, and facilitate the implementation of solutions. The CSIRT is responsible for identifying the intrusion techniques and vulnerabilities associated with the incident and recommending and coordinating deployment of management-approved technical and administrative solutions. The documents also provide evidence of a Computer Security Incident Response Plan (CSIRP) that outlines the scope of the plan and the extent of the CSIRP that applies to the bank [doc3]. The CSIRP includes the identification, classification, response, and recovery from the incident. The plan details roles and responsibilities, procedures for communication (both internal and external), escalation processes, and decision-making protocols. The documents also provide evidence of incident response drill tests that are conducted on an annual basis to train the CSIRT to understand how to respond in the event of an incident [doc2]. The testing aims to prepare the CSIRT for an actual event and helps to ensure that the CSIRP is up-to-date and effective in response to existing risk profile and latest threat intelligence.
